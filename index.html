<h1>In the Aftermath of Rape</h1>

<p>Some aftermaths are longer than others. Some aftermaths last forever. It's easy to come up with some aftermaths. The aftermath of war. The aftermath of a tsunami. The aftermath of a fire. But what about the aftermath of rape? What does that look like to you?</p>

<p>The fact is that I'm still in it. And it doesn't look like what you might be thinking. It isn't always horrifically violent. It probably isn't an unfamiliar face that caused it. And no, he certainly did know what he was knowing when he did it.</p>
